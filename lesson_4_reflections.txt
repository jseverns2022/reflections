1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repository allows you to collaborate with others while working in projects. Also if i want to show someone my does I would use a remote repository. Overall remote repository are a great way of updating and saving code.
2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You want to pull changes manually because it allows you to totally control what is going to be in your repository and it allows you organize your commits in terminal.
3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches add the new changes into the existing repositoryForking copies a repository in to a new location but forking a a special git hub tool. Cloning copies the repository into a new location
4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
One benefit is if you are goin on a plane or to a place with no internet. You can even merge while you are offline.
5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Git hub is set up in a way that makes it easy to collaborate therefore it would be a lot harder to collaborate not on git hub. The features that are set in place for git hub make it very easy to collaborate.
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
Making changes in a separate branch allows you to save different versions of the code and go back to the previous version whenever you want. Working on a branch is better in large groups because it allows everyone to have their own versions.
