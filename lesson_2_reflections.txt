What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

It allows you to control how much storage your computer is using to save all the files and you can save the files during big changes in your writing process.


Why do you think some version control systems like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Because it saves storage and makes it easier to go back to older documents.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git diff shows the difference from the old files to the new files whole log shows the old versions.

How might using version control makes you more confident to make changes that could break something?

It allows you to easily go back to an older version of the code if you make a mistake.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use it for my projects so that i have no fear in messing up my entire code.
