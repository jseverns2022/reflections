How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

Using a diff allowed us to easily identify the typos/misspelled words in the two different versions.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

It would allow us to easily figure out what the issue is without having to go through every line of code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

It allows you to always have a record of past code so that nothing gets deleted

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    By saving multiple files in one commit you can easily find out what the problem is in the code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log is a command that can be used to show the list of the all the commands that have been written. Git diff can be used to identify differences between two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
It allows us to go back and easily fix any issues we encounter without much effort.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to use Git to correct copies of a set of code and identify the differences between the two different versions.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

If you like on of your previous version you can always go back and use that version, also it is a lot easier to fix mistakes
